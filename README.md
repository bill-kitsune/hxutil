Package hxutil provides hx-specific convenience functions and types.
A starting suite of tests is provided to ensure proper functionality, but they are
still in active development to consider the new postquantum implementations.  

This package was modified for hxd, a full-node implementation of Hx which
is under active development by Hybrid.Network.

This package was originally developed for dcrd, a full-node implementation of Decred which
is under active development by Company 0.  Although it was primarily written for
dcrd, this package has intentionally been designed so it can be used as a
standalone package for any projects needing the functionality provided.

## Installation and Updating

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/hybridnetwork/hxutil
```

## License

Package hxutil, like dcrutil is licensed under the [copyfree](http://copyfree.org) ISC
